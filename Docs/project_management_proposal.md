Of course. As the Agile Project Manager for FlowSync AI, I have synthesized the PRD, Technical Plan, and Design Plan into an actionable project backlog.

**User Stories & Acceptance Criteria:**

**Epic 1: User Management & Core Platform Setup**
*   **User Story 1.1:** As a new user, I want to sign up using my GitHub OAuth account so that I don't have to create and remember another password.
    *   **AC1:** Given I am on the landing page, when I click "Sign up with GitHub", I am redirected to GitHub's OAuth screen.
    *   **AC2:** Given I successfully authenticate with GitHub, my user account is created in PostgreSQL, and I am logged into the FlowSync AI web app.
*   **User Story 1.2:** As a logged-in user, I want to create a new "Project" to represent the team or codebase I want to monitor.
    *   **AC1:** Given I am on the dashboard, I can click a "New Project" button, provide a name and description, and save it.
    *   **AC2:** Upon creation, the project is stored in the database and I am set as its admin.

**Epic 2: GitHub Integration & Signal Processing**
*   **User Story 2.1:** As a project admin, I want to connect my GitHub repository to my FlowSync project so that it can start receiving development signals.
    *   **AC1:** Given I am in the project settings, I can see an "Integrations" section with a "Connect GitHub" button.
    *   **AC2:** When I click it, I am guided through an OAuth flow to install a GitHub app (or connect an account) and select a specific repository.
    *   **AC3:** Upon success, the integration's status is shown as "Active" in the settings, and a webhook is created on the GitHub repository.
*   **User Story 2.2:** As the system, I want to receive GitHub webhooks for PR events (open, close, merge, comment) so I can update the context graph.
    *   **AC1:** Given a webhook is received from GitHub, the payload is validated and authenticated.
    *   **AC2:** The relevant event data (PR ID, author, state, timestamp) is parsed and placed into a message queue for async processing.
    *   **AC3:** A worker consumes the message and creates or updates corresponding nodes (User, PullRequest) and relationships in the Neo4j graph.

**Epic 3: Automated Standup Digest Generation & Delivery**
*   **User Story 3.1:** As the system, I want to generate a daily digest of project status based on the context graph.
    *   **AC1:** Given a scheduled trigger (e.g., every 24 hours), the system queries the graph for all PRs and their states from the last 24 hours.
    *   **AC2:** The system formats this data into a structured text summary, grouping items by author or status (e.g., "Merged", "In Review", "Open").
*   **User Story 3.2:** As a user, I want to receive the daily digest in a Slack channel so I don't have to open another app.
    *   **AC1:** Given a project has a connected Slack channel, when the digest is generated, it is posted to that channel via the Slack API.
    *   **AC2:** The message is formatted using Slack blocks and is clearly identifiable as coming from FlowSync AI.

**Epic 4: Web Application & Dashboard**
*   **User Story 4.1:** As a user, I want to see a dashboard overview of my project's health and recent activity so I can get a quick status update.
    *   **AC1:** Given I am logged in and navigate to a project, I see a list of the most recent Pull Requests and their statuses.
    *   **AC2:** I see a summary card indicating the number of active PRs, merged PRs, etc.
*   **User Story 4.2:** As a user, I want to click on a PR from the digest or dashboard to see detailed information and the source data it came from.
    *   **AC1:** Given I am viewing a digest in Slack or the dashboard, I can click a link that takes me to a detail view for that specific PR.
    *   **AC2:** The detail view shows all information from GitHub (title, author, link, status, comments) that was used to generate the summary.

**Epic 5: Onboarding & Activation Flow**
*   **User Story 5.1:** As a new user, I want to be guided through the initial setup process after sign-up.
    *   **AC1:** After sign-up, the user is presented with a modal or series of steps prompting them to 1) Create a Project, 2) Connect GitHub, 3) Connect Slack.
    *   **AC2:** The progress is saved, and the user can exit and return later.
*   **User Story 5.2:** As the system, I want to track when a user receives their first digest to measure activation.
    *   **AC1:** Given a user has completed the onboarding steps, a metric is logged when the first digest is successfully sent to their Slack channel.
    *   **AC2:** This metric is accessible for analytics to calculate the >40% activation rate target.

### **Prioritized Backlog**

**Theme: MVP (v0.5) - "Core Automated Digest"**
*   **Must Haves:**
    1.  User Story 1.1 (Sign up with GitHub OAuth)
    2.  User Story 1.2 (Create a Project)
    3.  User Story 2.1 (Connect GitHub Repo)
    4.  User Story 2.2 (Process GitHub Webhooks -> Graph)
    5.  User Story 3.1 (Generate Daily Digest from Graph)
    6.  User Story 3.2 (Send Digest to Slack)
    7.  User Story 5.1 (Guided Onboarding)
    8.  User Story 4.1 (Basic Dashboard with PR List)
*   **Should Haves:**
    1.  User Story 4.2 (PR Detail View with Source Links)
    2.  User Story 5.2 (Track Activation Metric)
*   **Could Haves:**
    1.  *Stories from Epic 6 (Basic Confidence Scoring) would be here, but are deferred to v1.0 for this initial plan.*

### **Suggested Sprint 1 Backlog (2-Week Cycle)**

**Sprint Goal:** Establish the core platform and successfully receive the first webhook from GitHub.

This sprint focuses on the absolute foundation: user auth, project context, and the first working integration. The "working software" at the end of this sprint will be a basic app that can connect to GitHub and log incoming webhooks.

1.  **User Story 1.1:** Sign up with GitHub OAuth.
    *   **Tasks:** Implement OAuth flow with GitHub; Create user model in PostgreSQL; Handle session management.
2.  **User Story 1.2:** Create a new Project.
    *   **Tasks:** Create project model and API endpoints; Build basic UI form in React; Link project to user.
3.  **User Story 2.1:** Connect my GitHub repository.
    *   **Tasks:** Implement GitHub App installation/OAuth flow; Store integration metadata (repo name, installation ID); Update UI to show connection status.
4.  **Infrastructure & Architecture:**
    *   **Task:** Set up initial Kubernetes deployment with a Node.js API pod and PostgreSQL pod.
    *   **Task:** Set up basic Neo4j instance (schema not required yet, just connection).
    *   **Task:** Implement message queue (RabbitMQ) and a basic worker skeleton.
    *   **Task:** Build webhook endpoint to receive GitHub events and place them on the message queue.
    *   **Task:** Build a worker that consumes messages from the queue and simply logs them. (This validates the entire pipeline).

**Sprint 1 Outcome:** A user can sign up, create a project, connect a GitHub repo, and the system will log incoming webhook events to the console. This is a minimal but crucial vertical slice that de-risks the integration architecture.
