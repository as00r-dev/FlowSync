# Session Management Approach

## Overview
This document describes the session management approach for FlowSync AI, focusing on security and GDPR compliance.

## Approach

We will use a server-side session store with the following characteristics:

1. **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL database (same as user data)
2. **Session ID**: Cryptographically secure random string
3. **Session Data**: Minimal session data stored server-side
4. **Cookie**: HTTP-only, secure cookie with session ID
5. **Expiration**: Sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity

## Session Flow

1. After successful OAuth authentication:
   - Create a new session record in the database
   - Generate a secure session ID
   - Store minimal session data (user ID, creation time, last access time)
   - Set HTTP-only, secure cookie with session ID

2. For authenticated requests:
   - Extract session ID from cookie
   - Look up session in database
   - Verify session hasn't expired
   - Update last access time
   - Attach user information to request context

3. Session cleanup:
   - Expire sessions after 24 hours of inactivity
   - Periodically clean up expired sessions

## Session Table Schema

### Table: sessions

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| id | VARCHAR(128) | PRIMARY KEY | Session ID (secure random string) |
| user_id | INTEGER | NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY to users(id) | Associated user |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | When the session was created |
| last_accessed_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | When the session was last accessed |
| expires_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | When the session expires |
| ip_address | VARCHAR(45) |  | IP address of client (for security monitoring) |
| user_agent | TEXT |  | User agent string (for security monitoring) |

## Security Considerations

- Session IDs are cryptographically secure random strings (128-bit entropy)
- Sessions are stored server-side, not in cookies
- Cookies are HTTP-only (not accessible via JavaScript)
- Cookies are secure (only sent over HTTPS)
- Sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity
- IP address and user agent stored for security monitoring
- Regular cleanup of expired sessions
- Rate limiting on session creation to prevent abuse

## GDPR Compliance

- Minimal data stored in sessions
- No personal data stored in session cookies
- Sessions automatically expire and are cleaned up
- Users can invalidate their sessions through account settings
