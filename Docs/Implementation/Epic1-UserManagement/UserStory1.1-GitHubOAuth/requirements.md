# User Story 1.1: GitHub OAuth Sign-Up Requirements

## Overview
As a new user, I want to sign up using my GitHub OAuth account so that I don't have to create and remember another password.

## Functional Requirements

- [ ] User is redirected to GitHub's OAuth screen for authentication
- [ ] Upon successful GitHub authentication, user account is created in PostgreSQL
- [ ] User is logged into the FlowSync AI web app after account creation

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] OAuth flow must be secure and follow GitHub's best practices
- [ ] User data from GitHub must be handled according to GDPR compliance
- [ ] Session management must be secure with proper token handling
- [ ] System must handle OAuth failures gracefully with user-friendly error messages

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Given I am on the landing page, when I click "Sign up with GitHub", I am redirected to GitHub's OAuth screen.
2. [ ] Given I successfully authenticate with GitHub, my user account is created in PostgreSQL, and I am logged into the FlowSync AI web app.
