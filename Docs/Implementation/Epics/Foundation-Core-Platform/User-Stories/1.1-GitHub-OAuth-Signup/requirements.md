# User Story 1.1: GitHub OAuth Signup Requirements

## Overview
As a new user, I want to sign up using my GitHub OAuth account so that I don't have to create a new password.

## Functional Requirements
- User can initiate sign up process through GitHub OAuth
- System redirects user to GitHub's OAuth screen
- System creates user account in PostgreSQL upon successful authentication
- User is logged into the FlowSync AI web app after successful authentication

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given I am on the landing page, when I click "Sign up with GitHub", I am redirected to GitHub's OAuth screen.
2. Given I successfully authenticate with GitHub, my user account is created in PostgreSQL, and I am logged into the FlowSync AI web app.

## Technical Considerations
- Integration with GitHub OAuth API
- User model in PostgreSQL database
- Session management for authenticated users
- Error handling for failed OAuth attempts
