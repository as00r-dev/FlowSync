# Implementation Report: User Story 1.1 - GitHub OAuth Signup (Final)

## Overview
This report summarizes the final implementation of GitHub OAuth signup functionality for FlowSync AI, allowing users to authenticate using their GitHub accounts with proper session management and ES module support.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Created `users` table with fields for GitHub ID, username, email, and avatar
- Created `sessions` table for session management
- Added appropriate indexes for performance

### 2. Authentication Service
- Implemented `GitHubOAuthService` for handling OAuth flow
- Added methods for generating authorization URLs
- Implemented token exchange with GitHub API
- Added user information retrieval from GitHub
- Created user creation/update logic
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Improved error messages for better debugging

### 3. Session Management
- Implemented proper session management using PostgreSQL sessions table
- Created session utilities in the auth package:
  - `createSession` - Creates a new session for a user
  - `getSession` - Retrieves a session by ID
  - `deleteSession` - Deletes a session by ID
  - `getUserFromSession` - Gets user information from a session
- Updated API routes to use session management:
  - `/api/auth/me` now properly returns user information based on session
  - `/api/auth/logout` now properly destroys sessions and clears cookies
  - `/api/auth/github/callback` now creates sessions and sets cookies after successful OAuth
- Implemented middleware to protect routes and check authentication status

### 4. API Gateway
- Added session middleware with PostgreSQL session store
- Created authentication routes (`/auth/github`, `/auth/github/callback`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/me`)
- Integrated with GraphQL context for authenticated requests
- Updated to use ES modules instead of CommonJS
- Added proper error handling for all API endpoints

### 5. Web Application
- Created login/signup UI with GitHub OAuth button
- Implemented user state management with proper session handling
- Added error handling for OAuth failures
- Implemented proper redirection after authentication
- Updated frontend components to handle authentication properly:
  - Home page redirects authenticated users to dashboard
  - Dashboard page shows access denied message for unauthenticated users
  - Added proper error handling for OAuth failures
- Configured to use ES modules throughout

### 6. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all OAuth steps
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Session cleanup on logout
- Added detailed logging for debugging purposes

### 7. Project Configuration
- Updated all packages to use ES modules instead of CommonJS
- Modified package.json files to include `"type": "module"`
- Updated TypeScript configuration to use ESNext modules
- Updated build scripts to properly handle ES module compilation
- Modified import paths to use `.js` extensions as required by ES modules
- Updated tsconfig.json files to include composite builds and references
- Fixed database test script to use relative imports instead of package imports

### 8. Docker Configuration
- Fixed Docker Compose configuration to use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`
- Added `--build` flag to ensure fresh builds when starting services
- Updated GitHub OAuth callback URL to use API Gateway port (4000) instead of web app port (3000)
- Added proper environment variable configuration for all services
- Ensured `docker-compose.yml` uses `env_file: ./.env` for services that need environment variables

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js with Next.js App Router (ES modules)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with node-postgres client
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL sessions table
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with React Server Components
- **OAuth**: GitHub OAuth 2.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j, Kafka, Zookeeper

### Security Considerations
- Secure session management with HTTP-only cookies
- Environment variable configuration for secrets
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- CSRF protection through OAuth flow

## Testing
- Manual testing of complete OAuth flow
- Session persistence verification
- Database schema validation
- Error scenario testing
- Successful build with no compilation errors
- Verified that Next.js dev server starts on correct port (3000)

## Docker Setup and Permission Issues Resolution

### Problem
- Encountered Docker permission denied error when running `npm run docker:start`
- Error was caused by user not being in the docker group

### Solution
- Added comprehensive permission checking to start-services.sh script
- Updated check-docker.sh script to validate Docker permissions
- Provided clear instructions for fixing Docker permission issues:
  1. Run `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
  2. Log out and log back in, or run `newgrp docker`
- Added npm scripts for easier Docker management:
  - `npm run docker:check` - Check Docker installation and permissions
  - `npm run docker:start` - Start services with proper error handling
  - `npm run db:setup` - Set up database for manual installation
- Updated README.md with comprehensive setup instructions for both Docker and manual installation

## Docker Kafka Configuration Issue and Fix

### Problem
- Encountered "ContainerConfig" KeyError when running `npm run docker:start`
- Issue was caused by incorrect Kafka configuration using KRaft mode

### Solution
- Switched from Kafka KRaft mode to traditional Zookeeper-based configuration
- Used specific, compatible versions of Kafka (3.2.3) and Zookeeper (3.8)
- Simplified environment variables for proper configuration
- Cleaned up all existing containers and volumes with `docker-compose down -v`
- Verified all services are now working correctly:
  - Kafka: Topic creation, message production and consumption working
  - PostgreSQL: Database connectivity working
  - Redis: Ping command working
  - Neo4j: HTTP endpoint responding
  - Zookeeper: Running and connected to Kafka
- The `npm run docker:start` command now works without errors

## Next.js Dev Server Port Issue and Fix

### Problem
- Encountered issue where `npm run dev` was starting on port 3004 instead of port 3000
- Root cause was orphaned next-server processes still running and occupying the ports

### Solution
- Identified and killed all orphaned next-server processes with `pkill -f next-server`
- Verified ports were free with `netstat -tulpn | grep :3000`
- Restarted the dev server which now correctly starts on port 3000
- Added troubleshooting documentation for future reference
- Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide for port issues

## Project Configuration Updates for ES Modules

### Problem
- Project was using CommonJS modules which caused compatibility issues with newer Node.js versions
- Import paths were not correctly configured for ES modules

### Solution
- Updated all package.json files to include `"type": "module"`
- Modified TypeScript configuration to use ESNext modules
- Updated build scripts to properly handle ES module compilation
- Modified import paths to use `.js` extensions as required by ES modules
- Updated tsconfig.json files to include composite builds and references
- Fixed database test script to use relative imports instead of package imports

## Deployment Notes
- Requires GitHub OAuth application credentials
- Environment variables must be configured
- PostgreSQL database must be available
- Session secret should be securely generated
- Docker Compose V2 is required for proper service orchestration

## Future Improvements
- Add unit and integration tests
- Implement refresh token handling
- Add support for other OAuth providers
- Enhance user profile management
- Add account linking functionality
