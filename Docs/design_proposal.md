**UX/UI Design Plan: FlowSync AI**

**1. User Flows**

The core value proposition is eliminating manual status updates. Therefore, the primary user flows center on setup, consumption of information, and proactive inquiry.

*   **Flow 1: Initial Onboarding & Integration Setup (Primary User: Engineering Manager)**
    1.  **Sign-Up:** User arrives at marketing site. Clicks "Get Started for Free." Authenticates via OAuth (GitHub/GitLab).
    2.  **Welcome & Goal Setting:** A welcome screen explains the value: "We'll automate your status reports." Asks user to select their primary role (e.g., Engineering Manager, Product Owner).
    3.  **Connect Repository:** A guided wizard presents the first step: "Connect your first repository." Provides clear instructions and a large button to authenticate with GitHub/GitLab. Status indicators show connection progress.
    4.  **Connect Communication Tool:** Next step: "Where should we send your updates?" Prompts to connect Slack (or email as fallback).
    5.  **First Value Delivery:** A final screen sets expectations: "Sit back and relax. Your first automated standup digest will arrive in your Slack #channel within 24 hours." Provides a link to the web dashboard.
    6.  **Activation:** Goal is achieved when the user receives and views their first digest.

*   **Flow 2: Consuming a Daily Standup Digest (Primary User: Engineering Manager, Product Owner)**
    1.  **Notification:** User receives a message in their connected Slack channel from the FlowSync AI bot.
    2.  **Scanning:** The message is structured with clear headers, developer/project names, and status items. Confidence scores (✅/⚠️/❓) are visually prominent.
    3.  **Drilling Down:** User sees an item with a medium-confidence score (⚠️). They can click a "View Details" link next to that item.
    4.  **Verification:** The link deep-links them into the web app to the specific item's detail view, showing the source signals (e.g., PR link, Jira ticket, conflicting Sentry error) that led to the confidence score.
    5.  **Action (Optional):** User can manually confirm or override the AI's assertion, providing corrective feedback.

*   **Flow 3: Querying Status via Chatbot (Primary User: Engineering Manager, Product Owner)**
    1.  **Initiation:** From the web dashboard, user clicks on the "Ask about status" chatbot button or types `/flowsync` in Slack.
    2.  **Query:** User types a natural language question: "What's the status of the user authentication feature? Is it blocked?"
    3.  **Processing:** The UI shows a typing indicator, subtly educating the user that it's "Analyzing PRs, commits, and tickets..."
    4.  **Response:** The chatbot returns a structured response. High-confidence answers are concise and bold. Medium/low confidence answers include the confidence indicator and a prominent "Review Evidence" button.
    5.  **Audit Trail:** The user can always click "See sources" to expand a section that lists every data point (with links) used to generate the answer.

**2. Screen Concepts & Wireframe Descriptions**

*   **Screen A: Dashboard Home (Primary Persona: Engineering Manager)**
    *   **Layout:** Three-column layout. Left column: Global navigation (Teams, Projects, Settings). Center column: Main content. Right column: Summary and alerts.
    *   **Top Header:** Greeting ("Good morning, [Name]"), Global search bar, Notifications bell icon, User profile menu.
    *   **Main Content Area:**
        *   **Project Health Overview:** A list of key projects/user stories. Each row shows the project name, a progress bar (based on completed tasks), and a color-coded health indicator (Green/Yellow/Red) derived from confidence scores and blocker status.
        *   **Recent Digests:** A collapsible section showing the last 3-5 automated digests sent to Slack, allowing the user to review them in-app.
    *   **Right Column:**
        *   **System Health:** A small card showing the status of integrated tools (GitHub, Jira, etc.) with green checkmarks or warning icons. Links to the detailed Integration Health Monitor.
        *   **Action Required:** A list itemizing any assertions requiring manual verification (e.g., "3 medium-confidence items need review").
    *   **Primary Action Button:** A prominent "Ask a Question" button floating near the chatbot interface.

*   **Screen B: Digest / Report Detail View**
    *   **Layout:** A modal or dedicated page triggered from a digest link or search result.
    *   **Header:** The core assertion being made (e.g., "Feature X is likely blocked").
    *   **Confidence Banner:** A full-width banner at the top color-coded and icon-driven (Green/Check, Yellow/Warning, Red/Question). Clearly states the confidence range (e.g., "60-80% Confidence").
    *   **Evidence List:** A card-based list of all source signals that contributed to this assertion.
        *   *Card Example:* "Pull Request #124 `[MERGED]`" [Link], "Linked Jira Ticket `[IN PROGRESS]`" [Link], "Sentry Error `[RESOLVED]`" [Link].
    *   **User Action Section:** Two buttons: "Confirm Assertion" (Primary), "Override/Correct" (Secondary). The override button opens a simple form to provide the correct information.

*   **Screen C: Chatbot Interface**
    *   **Layout:** A fixed-height drawer or modal that slides in from the right side of the screen.
    *   **Message History:** A scrollable view of the conversation. AI responses are visually distinct from user queries.
    *   **AI Message Component:**
        *   The core answer is displayed in clear, large text.
        *   The confidence indicator is placed immediately below the answer.
        *   A "Sources" accordion component can be expanded to reveal a verbatim list of sources with links.
    *   **Input Area:** A text input field with a hint text "Ask about project status..." and a send button.

*   **Screen D: Integration Health Monitor (Primary Persona: DevOps Lead/Admin)**
    *   **Layout:** Data-dense table layout.
    *   **Summary Metrics:** At the top: "All Systems Operational" or "1 Issue Detected." Uptime percentage.
    *   **Main Table:** A table listing each integrated service (GitHub, Jira, etc.). Columns include: Service Name, Status (with icon), Last Synced, Error Rate %, and Actions (Reconnect, View Logs).
    *   **Visualization:** A time-series graph showing sync health and error rates over the last 24 hours/7 days.

**3. Design System Components**

*   **Foundation:** We will use a modified version of **Material UI (MUI)** for its robust component library and theming capabilities, ensuring development efficiency.
*   **Confidence Indicators:** *Custom Components* are required.
    *   `ConfidencePill`: A pill-shaped badge containing an icon (✅, ⚠️, ❓) and text ("Likely", "Possible", "Insufficient Evidence"). Color and icon are determined by the confidence range prop.
    *   `ConfidenceBar`: A horizontal bar graph visualization for displaying the confidence range (e.g., a bar filling 60-80% of a track) for more detailed views.
*   **Buttons:** Standard MUI `Button` component with `variant="contained"` for primary actions (Confirm, Send) and `variant="outlined"` for secondary actions (Override, Cancel).
*   **Data Display:** Use MUI `Card`, `Chip`, and `Data Grid` components for displaying lists of projects, evidence, and integration health data. The data grid must support sorting and filtering.
*   **Feedback:** MUI `Alert` component for system messages, adapted with our custom confidence colors. `Skeleton` components will be used heavily during data loading to perceived performance.
*   **Navigation:** MUI `Drawer` for the main navigation sidebar. `Tabs` for switching between views on detail pages.

**4. UX Notes & Concerns**

1.  **Building Trust is Paramount:** The entire UI must constantly reinforce verifiability. The "View Sources" action must be one click away from any AI-generated assertion. Avoid black-box feelings.
2.  **Confidence Score Education:** Users will not intuitively understand the 60-80% range. An interactive tooltip (e.g., "What does this mean?") explaining the score in simple terms is crucial on its first appearance and readily available thereafter.
3.  **Avoiding Alert/Interaction Fatigue:** The safeguards against confirmation fatigue (e.g., forcing a pause) need a thoughtful UX. It shouldn't feel like a frustrating error message. Frame it as a "Let's double-check together" moment with clear, concise information to review.
4.  **Information Hierarchy for Different Roles:** The Product Owner's dashboard view must be a radically pruned subset of the Engineering Manager's view. We need a robust role-based UI switching mechanism, potentially with a view toggle ("Business View" / "Technical View").
5.  **GDPR and Transparency:** The UI must provide users with clear access to privacy settings and a straightforward way to submit data deletion requests, as mandated by the compliance model. This isn't a primary flow but must be easily discoverable in the user profile settings.
6.  **Performance Perception:** The Context Graph engine might have high latency on complex queries. The UI must manage user expectations with clear loading states (e.g., "Analyzing 124 code commits...") and skeleton screens. The chatbot should stream responses as they are generated to avoid long, silent pauses.
